# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

This Kata was done starting from the repository by Emily Bache https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

As per the requirements a TDD approach was followed. After this some refactoring was made into the main GuildedRose class, including:

- updateQuality method fragmentation into more specialized methods
- Extraction of utility methods into it's own class
